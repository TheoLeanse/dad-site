**For I am come home again, but there is nobody to**

**kill the calf or to pay the music.**

**\- Christopher Smart**

<br>

It is not easy to be young.

Running the length of a beach, as if

eating it up, as if in the jaw, but in strong light strides

is easy

but this is not being young.

Going away is being young.

<br>

It is not easy to go away,


to leave home when the call comes


pretending to know things…as if buying


clothes you can afford yet cannot afford,


then wearing them, and in the wearing earning


the wherewithal to afford them


but this is not being young


failing to know things is being young.

<br>

And coming home with nothing is being young.


Laying your cheek very gently on your father’s side,


your money gone, nothing left, your shoes gone,


_why does he welcome me home_, you wonder,


your old father as true to the son he has not forgotten


as to his own heart. _Why does he give me his time?_

<br>

But it’s true. While time remains he is embracing you.


Before you wondered…the reason is suddenly simple:


he knows you like his own heart.

<br>

Better than had you come back with wealth.


Better than had you come home with a wife.

<br>

For although you are young and have failed yourself,


failed your promise, squandered your money,


you have not failed your father; no, more than that,


you’ve come as only your failing could let you come 


to meet him.

<br> 
You see you failed, and meanwhile he has grown old.


And only the child who comes home with nothing


brings him the truth he has sensed in this time.

<br>

Despite his rich clothes that he can afford,


despite the delight he has never lost in his child,


even despite this hard-won reunion itself,


he has learned something about coming home with nothing:

<br>
home, believing he won’t be welcomed.


Certain when walking back through the family door


as his son was that he his father could not accept him,\
so this father knows losing, knows being resigned


to a bleak home-coming stripped even of his shame.

<br>
And so the chance of this welcome is very dear


and to bring this child comfort and love is very dear.


The occasion is great because home is where we have come from


and coming home with nothing is also being old;


and so he knows this boy like his own heart.
